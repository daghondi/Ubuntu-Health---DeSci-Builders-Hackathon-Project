# Ubuntu Health - Advanced Medical Treatment Platform Development Plan

## üéØ Mission: Complete Advanced Medical Treatment Sponsorship Platform

**Goal**: Complete development of Ubuntu Health as a comprehensive advanced medical treatment sponsorship platform, focusing on CAR-T therapy, gene therapy, and cutting-edge longevity treatments while maintaining decentralized governance and transparent outcome tracking.

## üåê **NETWORK STATE RELEVANCE: DECENTRALIZED MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE**

Ubuntu Health has strong relevance to Network States by creating decentralized medical treatment infrastructure that transcends traditional healthcare boundaries. We're building globally-distributed, community-governed medical funding ecosystems that enable advanced treatment access without relying on centralized state-based systems.

## üéØ Mission: Build Decentralized Advanced Medical Treatment Access

```typescript
// Token contract integration
interface LIVESTokenConfig {
  tokenMint: string;
  treasuryAccount: string;
  sponsorshipRewards: {
    baseReward: number;
    milestoneBonus: number;
    ubuntuHealthBonus: number; // Ubuntu Health membership bonus
  };
  researchContributionRewards: {
    dataContribution: number;
    privacyPreservingSharing: number;
  };
}
```

### Phase 2: Recovery Documentation System (Weeks 5-8)

#### 2.1 Recovery Logging Platform
**New Components to Build:**
