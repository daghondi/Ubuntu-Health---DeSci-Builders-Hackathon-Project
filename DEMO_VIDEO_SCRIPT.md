# Ubuntu Health - Demo Video Script

## ðŸŽ¬ DEMO VIDEO PRODUCTION PLAN (3-5 Minutes)

### **SCENE 1: HOOK & PROBLEM (30 seconds)**
**Visual:** Split screen showing expensive medical treatments vs patients in need
**Script:** 
"Imagine needing a $400,000 CAR-T therapy that could save your life, but insurance won't cover it. Or wanting to contribute to medical research but having no way to monetize your health data while protecting your privacy. This is the healthcare access crisis facing millions globally."

### **SCENE 2: SOLUTION OVERVIEW (45 seconds)**
**Visual:** Screen recording of Ubuntu Health homepage
**Script:**
"Meet Ubuntu Health - a decentralized platform that democratizes healthcare through blockchain technology and the Ubuntu philosophy of 'I am because we are.' We connect patients needing advanced treatments with global sponsors, while enabling privacy-preserving research data contribution."

### **SCENE 3: LIVE PLATFORM DEMO (2 minutes)**

#### **A. Patient Journey (30 seconds)**
**Visual:** Screen recording navigating patient features
**Script:**
"Let me show you how it works. As a patient, I can create a treatment request for expensive procedures like gene therapy or CAR-T treatments. The platform generates an NFT treatment pass that sponsors can fund through milestone-based smart contracts."

#### **B. Research Data Contribution (45 seconds)**
**Visual:** Screen recording of research data interface
**Script:**
"But here's what makes us unique - patients can also monetize their anonymized health data. Using zero-knowledge proofs, patients contribute treatment outcomes, biomarkers, and lifestyle data to earn LIVES tokens while maintaining complete privacy. They earn 300-2000 tokens per contribution."

#### **C. Community Governance (30 seconds)**
**Visual:** Screen recording of community features
**Script:**
"Everything is governed by the Ubuntu community. Research partnerships require community approval, and traditional healing practices are integrated with respect for cultural protocols."

#### **D. Sponsor & Research Access (15 seconds)**
**Visual:** Screen recording of sponsor dashboard and API access
**Script:**
"Sponsors can fund treatments and track impact, while researchers access privacy-preserving data through our token-gated API."

### **SCENE 4: TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (45 seconds)**
**Visual:** Code snippets and architecture diagrams
**Script:**
"Built on Solana blockchain with Rust smart contracts, our platform implements zero-knowledge proofs for privacy, milestone-based escrow for security, and IPFS for decentralized storage. We've integrated all five DeSci hackathon tracks into one comprehensive solution."

### **SCENE 5: IMPACT & CALL TO ACTION (30 seconds)**
**Visual:** Platform stats and community impact
**Script:**
"Ubuntu Health isn't just a platform - it's a movement toward healthcare equity. We're enabling patients to access life-saving treatments while contributing to medical research. Join us in building a world where healthcare access is a human right, not a privilege."

**End Screen:** Ubuntu Health logo + "Built for DeSci Builders Hackathon 2025"
