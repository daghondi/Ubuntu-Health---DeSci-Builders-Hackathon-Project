## 🏥 **UPDATED PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Treatment Discovery & Matching**
```typescript
interface AdvancedTreatment {
  treatmentId: string;
  treatmentType: 'longevity' | 'cancer' | 'gene-therapy' | 'experimental';
  medicalFacility: VerifiedProvider;
  estimatedCost: number;
  successRate: number;
  patientCriteria: MedicalCriteria;
  geographicAvailability: string[];
  experimentalStatus: boolean;
  regulatoryApproval: RegulatoryStatus;
}

interface SponsorshipRequest {
  patientId: string;
  medicalCondition: string;
  desiredTreatment: AdvancedTreatment;
  urgencyLevel: 'critical' | 'high' | 'moderate';
  sponsorshipGoal: number;
  medicalDocumentation: IPFSHash;
  treatmentTimeline: TreatmentMilestone[];
}
```

### **Smart Contract Treatment Escrow**
```rust
// Updated Rust Smart Contract for Advanced Medical Treatments
#[program]
pub mod advanced_treatment_escrow {
    use super::*;

    pub fn create_treatment_sponsorship(
        ctx: Context<CreateSponsorship>,
        treatment_type: TreatmentType,
        estimated_cost: u64,
        medical_provider: Pubkey,
        treatment_milestones: Vec<TreatmentMilestone>,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        let sponsorship = &mut ctx.accounts.sponsorship;
        sponsorship.treatment_type = treatment_type;
        sponsorship.estimated_cost = estimated_cost;
        sponsorship.medical_provider = medical_provider;
        sponsorship.milestones = treatment_milestones;
        sponsorship.status = SponsorshipStatus::FundingOpen;
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn verify_treatment_milestone(
        ctx: Context<VerifyMilestone>,
        milestone_id: u8,
        medical_proof: Vec<u8>, // Cryptographic proof from medical provider
    ) -> Result<()> {
        let sponsorship = &mut ctx.accounts.sponsorship;
        let milestone = &mut sponsorship.milestones[milestone_id as usize];
        
        // Verify medical proof cryptographically
        require!(verify_medical_signature(&medical_proof, &sponsorship.medical_provider), ErrorCode::InvalidMedicalProof);
        
        milestone.completed = true;
        milestone.verification_timestamp = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
        
        // Release milestone funds
        let milestone_amount = sponsorship.estimated_cost * milestone.funding_percentage / 100;
        release_escrow_funds(ctx, milestone_amount)?;
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
