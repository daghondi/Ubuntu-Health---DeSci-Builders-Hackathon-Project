# Ubuntu Health Technical Architecture

*Comprehensive technical overview of the Ubuntu Health healthcare sponsorship platform*

## 🌍 Architecture Philosophy

Ubuntu Health's architecture embodies the Ubuntu philosophy of **"I am because we are"** through its design principles:

- **Decentralized by Design**: Blockchain-based smart contracts with no single point of failure
- **Community-Centric**: Platform connects patients, sponsors, and healthcare providers
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Zero-knowledge proofs for research contribution
- **Transparent**: All funding and milestone progress visible on blockchain
- **Scalable**: Built on Solana for high-throughput healthcare transactions
