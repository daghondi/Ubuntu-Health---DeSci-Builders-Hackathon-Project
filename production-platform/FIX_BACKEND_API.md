# 🔴 Fix Backend API Routes

## ✅ Great Progress!
- ✅ **Site is LIVE** at https://www.tale-verse.app
- ✅ **Frontend loading** properly
- ❌ **Backend/API routes offline** (returning 404)

## 🔧 Issue: API Routes Not Found

The API endpoints are returning 404 because Vercel might not be detecting the API routes properly.

## 🎯 Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Check vercel.json Configuration

Let's ensure the new project has the correct vercel.json:

1. **Go to your new project** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Check if vercel.json was deployed** with the project
3. **Or manually add the configuration**

### Fix 2: Verify API Routes Structure

Your API routes should be in:
```
production-platform/frontend/pages/api/
```
OR
```
production-platform/frontend/app/api/
```

### Fix 3: Redeploy with API Configuration

Let's redeploy from CLI to ensure everything is included:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd "D:\Ubuntu Health - DeSci Builders Hackathon Project\Ubuntu-Health---DeSci-Builders-Hackathon-Project\production-platform\frontend"

# Deploy to your new project
vercel --prod
```

### Fix 4: Check Environment Variables

**Make sure these are set in your new project:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://www.tale-verse.app
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url-if-needed
```

## 🔍 Quick Diagnosis

Let's check what's actually deployed:

```powershell
# Test different API endpoints
curl -I "https://www.tale-verse.app/api/v1/health"
curl -I "https://www.tale-verse.app/api/status"
curl "https://www.tale-verse.app/api/health"
```

## 🚀 Likely Solution

**Most likely fix:** The API routes from your `vercel.json` or API directory weren't properly included. Let's redeploy:

1. **Use Vercel CLI** to deploy from your local machine
2. **This ensures all files are included**
3. **API routes should work after redeploy**

---

## 🎯 Action Plan

1. **Redeploy using CLI** (most likely to fix it)
2. **Check environment variables** in new project
3. **Test API endpoints** after redeploy
4. **Your site will be fully functional!**

**Try the CLI redeploy first - that usually fixes API route issues!** 🚀
