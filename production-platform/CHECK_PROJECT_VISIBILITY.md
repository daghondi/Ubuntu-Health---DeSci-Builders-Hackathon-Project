# 🔍 Check Project Visibility Settings

## 🚨 Current Issue
Your deployment still returns `401 Unauthorized` with SSO authentication cookies, indicating the project has restricted access.

## 📋 What to Check Next

### Step 1: Check Project Visibility
1. **Go to**: Settings → **General** (not Security)
2. **Look for**: "Project Visibility" section
3. **Current setting**: Probably "Private" or "Team Only"
4. **Change to**: "Public"
5. **Save changes**

### Step 2: Check Team Settings
If you don't see Project Visibility:
1. **Look for**: "Team Access" or "Access Control"
2. **Current setting**: Might be restricted to team members
3. **Change to**: Allow public access

### Step 3: Alternative - Environment Variables
The protection might be coming from:
1. **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. **Look for**: Any authentication-related variables
3. **Check for**: `VERCEL_PROTECT` or similar variables

## 🎯 Expected Settings

**Project Visibility should be:**
- ✅ **Public** (allows anyone to access)
- ❌ **Private** (requires authentication)
- ❌ **Team Only** (requires team membership)

## 🔧 After Making Changes

1. **Redeploy** to apply changes:
   ```powershell
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Test deployment** (should return 200, not 401):
   ```powershell
   curl -I "https://ubuntu-health-frontend-7yaau4x2s-ghondi-claudes-projects.vercel.app"
   ```

3. **Test custom domain**:
   ```powershell
   curl -I "https://www.tale-verse.app"
   ```

## 📱 If You Can't Find Project Visibility

**Screenshot or copy what you see under:**
- Settings → General (top section)
- Settings → Security (any authentication settings)

This will help identify exactly where the access restriction is configured.

## 🎯 Summary

The `401 Unauthorized` with SSO cookies indicates your project is set to **Private** or **Team Only**. 

**Find the Project Visibility setting and change it to Public** - this should immediately resolve the authentication issue and allow your custom domain to work! 🚀
