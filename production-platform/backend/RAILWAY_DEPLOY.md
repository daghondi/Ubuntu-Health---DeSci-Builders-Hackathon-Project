```

2. **Initialize Railway project**:
```bash
railway init
```

3. **Deploy to Railway**:
```bash
railway up
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in Railway dashboard:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
CORS_ORIGINS=https://frontend-dv6ndpb3m-ghondi-claudes-projects.vercel.app,https://ubuntuhealth.io
```

### Step 4: Custom Start Command

In Railway, set the start command to:
```
node server.js
```

## üåê Production API Endpoints

Once deployed, the API will be available at:
- Health Check: `https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/health`
- API Docs: `https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/api-docs`
- Test: `https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/test`
