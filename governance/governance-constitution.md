# Ubuntu Health DAO Governance Constitution

*Establishing community-driven healthcare governance rooted in Ubuntu philosophy*

## Preamble

**"Ubuntu ngumuntu ngabantu"** - "I am because we are"

This constitution establishes the governance framework for Ubuntu Health, a decentralized healthcare platform that embodies the African philosophy of Ubuntu. Our governance system recognizes that individual healing strengthens the entire community, and that collective decision-making guided by Ubuntu principles ensures healthcare access that honors both individual sovereignty and communal responsibility.
