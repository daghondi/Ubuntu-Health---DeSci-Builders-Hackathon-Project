## Week 1: Audit Firm Outreach (THIS WEEK)

### Day 1-2: Initial Contact with Top Firms

#### **Email Template for Audit Firms:**

**Subject**: Ubuntu Health - Smart Contract Security Audit Request (Solana/Healthcare)

Dear [Audit Firm] Security Team,

Ubuntu Health is a community-centered healthcare platform built on Solana that integrates traditional healing practices with blockchain technology. We're preparing for mainnet deployment and require a comprehensive security audit.

**Project Overview:**
- Platform: Solana blockchain (Rust/Anchor)
- Scope: Milestone escrow, LIVES token, Treatment Pass NFTs
- Special Requirements: Healthcare compliance (HIPAA), traditional knowledge protection
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks
- Budget: $50K-75K

**Key Contracts for Review:**
1. Milestone Escrow System (community-governed healthcare funding)
2. LIVES Token Economics (utility token with governance features)
3. Treatment Pass NFT System (tokenized healthcare access)

**Unique Considerations:**
- Healthcare data privacy requirements
- Community governance integration (Elder Council oversight)
- Traditional knowledge protection protocols
- Ubuntu philosophy integration in smart contracts

Could we schedule a 30-minute consultation call this week to discuss our requirements and your availability?

Best regards,
Ubuntu Health Development Team
