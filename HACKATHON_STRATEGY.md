    pub medical_provider: Pubkey,
    pub total_cost: u64,
    pub milestones: Vec<TreatmentMilestone>,
    pub sponsors: Vec<Sponsor>,
    pub status: SponsorshipStatus,
}

pub enum TreatmentType {
    CancerTherapy,
    GeneTherapy,
    LongevityTreatment,
    ExperimentalDrug,
    RegenerativeMedicine,
}
```

### NFT Treatment Passes
- **Cancer Treatment Pass**: Access rights to CAR-T therapy
