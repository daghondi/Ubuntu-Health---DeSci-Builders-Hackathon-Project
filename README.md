## 🎯 Use Case Example: "Ubuntu Diaspora Healing Loop"

A patient in Yaoundé, Cameroon needs treatment but lacks funds. Their diaspora community in Paris creates a sponsorship through Ubuntu Health:

1. **Community Mobilization**: Paris-based Ubuntu community reviews patient story
2. **Collective Funding**: Community pools $LIVES tokens in smart contract escrow
3. **Treatment Access**: Patient receives NFT treatment pass for verified healthcare
4. **Progress Documentation**: Recovery logged with timestamps and community validation
5. **Cultural Integration**: Traditional healers provide ancestral wisdom alongside modern medicine
6. **Data Contribution**: Patient opts to share anonymized data for research, earning $LIVES rewards
7. **Story Preservation**: Healing journey becomes part of Ubuntu Health cultural museum
8. **Community Impact**: Success inspires other communities and validates Ubuntu healthcare model
